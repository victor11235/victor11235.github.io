![Choosing between quantum and classical worlds](/images/quantum_1.png){: .align-right width="300px"}
🏫 I am starting my PhD (Applied Physics) at Stanford University in June 2024. I finished my undergrduate studies in Physics and Computer Science at McGill University (❄️🌲 ➡️ 🌞🌴). 

👨‍🔬 I squeezed my undergrad into 3 years and spent a lovely gap year doing research at the Institute for Quantum Computing in Waterloo.

⚛️ My research interests include quantum information science and its intersections with the classical world, with an emphasis on experimental realization.
