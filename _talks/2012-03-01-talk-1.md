Quantum state tomography (QST) is the art of reconstructing an unknown quantum state through measurements. It is a key primitive for developing quantum technologies. Neural network quantum state tomography (NNQST), which aims to reconstruct the quantum state via a neural network ansatz, is often implemented via a basis-dependent cross-entropy loss function. State-of-the-art implementations of NNQST are often restricted to characterizing a particular subclass of states, to avoid an exponential growth in the number of required measurement settings. In this talk, I will discuss an alternative neural-network-based QST protocol that uses shadow-estimated infidelity as the loss function, named “neural-shadow quantum state tomography” (NSQST). After introducing NNQST and the classical shadow formalism, I will present numerical results on the advantage of NSQST over NNQST at learning the relative phases, NSQST’s noise robustness, and NSQST’s advantage over direct shadow estimation. I will also briefly discuss the future prospects of the protocol with different variational ansatz and randomized measurements, as well as its experimental feasibility.
